## Setup

Install the project dependencies:

`yarn install`

## Running

Update config.json with your Twitter API credentials.
Start the static and proxy servers:

`yarn start`

This server will help you to get Twitter's API to send you tweets without you needing to do any authentication.  You don't need to modify server.js at all. 

Run the frontend web application:

`yarn dev`

Run unit tests:

`yarn test`
